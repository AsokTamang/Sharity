     Sharity is a peer-to-peer exchange platform that fosters sustainable living by enabling users to give away or receive items they no longer need. Through our intuitive app, users can list goods they wish to part with and connect with others in the community who may benefit from them. By facilitating mutual agreements between users, the platform promotes responsible consumption, reduces waste, and encourages meaningful connections through item sharing.
